Conway's Life on the GPU using WebGL.

[Launch](https://thenumbernine.github.io/conway-life-webgl/)

The WebGL code was taken from my Topple Abelian Sandpile Model project: https://github.com/thenumbernine/topple-js .
I should've forked it, I know, I know.

What I should really do is make a separate framework for these 2D kernel-driven GPGPU projects, so I can reuse the functionality easily.

The GLSL kernel was taken frm my old, old "Conway's Life on the GPU" GLuSh project: http://christopheremoore.net/gpu-conway-life .

Enjoy!
